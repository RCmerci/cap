router:
	prefix: a string stands for `this Router instance's presix url`.
		it is not a `regex` but string.
	
	any:url-func-dict:
		[(url, func), ...]
	get:url-func-dict:
		pass
	post:url-func-dict:
		pass
	other-method:url-func-dict:
		pass
    `no url matched in [get,post,...]`,then fallback on [any]

    	function add(method="any", url, func):
		 add (url, func) to [method] corresponding list.
		 earlier added func has higher priority.

	function del(method="any", url):
		 just delete the tuple in [method] list
		 !!! but [url] is regex,
		 it's hard and some how useless to delete a url,func tuple.
	function clear(method="all"):
		 if method=="all":
		    clear all (any, get, post ...) list into empty.
		 else :
		      just clear the [method] list.

	function route(url, method="any"):
		 decorator version of `add`
